# Assignment-1

## 1. Use [Carseats data](https://www.kaggle.com/huhao05133/carseats) to predict the sales based on select predictors following the steps:
- Step 1: Do exploratory analysis and comment on the findings.
- Step 2: You have learnt several ML algorithms so far, please use appropriate ML algorithms to fit model(s) to the data and choose the best model for prediction stating reason.

### Discussion

- Total number of instances = **400**
- Number of predictors = **10**
- Response variable = **Sales**
- Categorical features = **ShelveLoc**, **Urban** and **US**

PCA is applied on the dataset for the ease of visualization.
